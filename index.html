      <p>
        Welcome to my humble web design system. It's purpose is to help build a
        basic design for other websites to come.
      </p>
      <p>And it isn't a finished product.</p>

        <h2>Colours</h2>
        <p>
          Colour defines the emotional meaning and depth of the website - all
          based on the emotions they evoke within us. This makes it all the more
          important to ensure that the correct combination and amount of colour
          is used in your websites. Contrast is key to the overall design of a
          website. The one thing to remember is as much as they're beautiful,
          colours can make - or break - your website. And that isn't going to be
          a pretty site.
