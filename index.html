      <p>
        Welcome to my humble web design system. It's purpose is to serve as a
        basic design for other websites to come.
      </p>
      <p>And it isn't a finished product. No website will ever be.</p>

      <h2>Colours</h2>
      <p>
        Colour defines the emotional meaning and depth of the website - all
        based on the emotions they evoke within us. This makes it all the more
        important to ensure that the correct combination and amount of colour
        is used in your websites. Contrast is key to the overall design of a
        website. The one thing to remember is as much as they're beautiful,
        colours can make - or break - your website. And that isn't going to be
        a pretty site.

      <!-- Colours Swatches -->
      <h3>Sandy Green and Earth Green</h3>
      <ul class="green-swatch">
        <div class="swatch-1-foreground">

            <h4>Foreground</h4>
            <span>#bbb44a</span>
          </li>
          <span>Primary</span>
        </div>
        <div class="swatch-1-background">

          </li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Sandy Green and Earth Green - Reversed</h3>
      <ul class="green-swatch">
        <div class="swatch-1-foreground">
          <li>
            <h4>Foreground</h4>
            <span>#0d1901</span>
          </li>
          <span>Primary</span>
        </div>
        <div class="swatch-1-background">
          <li>
            <h4>Background</h4>
            <span>#bbb44a</span>
          </li>
          <span>Secondary</span>
        </div>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The swatches above are examples of two colours brightened and darkened from a single colour, SpringGreen, but contrasted effectively to build an atmosphere of harmony while emphasising key information on a site. This combination could be used in a site based around nature and conservation, possibly suggesting we should live in harmony with nature.
