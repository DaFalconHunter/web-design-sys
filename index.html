          Welcome to my humble web design system. It's purpose is to serve as a
          basic design for other websites to come.<br><br>And it isn't a finished product. No website will ever be.</p>

      <p>
        Colour defines the emotional meaning and depth of the website - all
        based on the emotions they evoke within us. This makes it all the more
        important to ensure that the correct combination and amount of colour
        is used in your websites. Contrast is key to the overall design of a
        website. The one thing to remember is as much as they're beautiful,
        colours can make - or break - your website. And that isn't going to be
        a pretty site.

      <p>
        The swatches above are examples of two colours brightened and darkened from a single colour, SpringGreen, but contrasted effectively to build an atmosphere of harmony while emphasising key information on a site. This combination could be used in a site based around nature and conservation, possibly suggesting we should live in harmony with nature. It also provides a harmonious light and dark theme to switch between that can be implemented on the site.

    <!-- Typography -->
    <section id="typography">
      <h2 class="section-header">Typography</h2>
      <p>
        Typography is the art of styling and arranging text on any medium that has been designed to convey information. It is affects how we take in information and whether we will remember it enough to be willing to visit the website again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finding fonts that fit seamlessly together can be quite a challenge, given the vast amount of different fonts at out disposal. As a general rule of thumb, never use more than three fonts on a website unless there is no other way around it. A good resource to use is <a class="text" href="https://reliablepsd.com/ultimate-google-font-pairings/" >this collection of Google Font Pairings</a> which will save you a lot of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        These fonts are all taken from Google Fonts, but you may use any resource you wish.

      <h1>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</h1>
      <h2>By Douglas Adams</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">Pages: 208</p>
      <h2>Preface</h2>
      <p>
        Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of 
        the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow 
        sun.<br> 
        Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an 
        utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life 
        forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches 
        are a pretty neat idea.<br> 
        This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most 
        of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many 
        solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were 
        largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, 
        which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of 
        paper that were unhappy.
